## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
      And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
      The frumious Bandersnatch!”  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright—  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done—  
'It's very rude of him,' she said,  
'To come and spoil the fun!'"  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the realm of circuits and code, they dwell,  
Machines of logic, where wonders often swell.  
Computers, woven with electric might,  
Transcending limits, expanding our sight.  

Silicon minds, a symphony of wires,  
Whispering secrets, fulfilling desires.  
Bits and bytes dance in rhythmic trance,  
Unlocking realms with every single chance.  

From punch cards to keyboards, they evolved,  
Aided progress, conundrums solved.  
They crunch numbers, swift calculations flow,  
Unraveling mysteries we yearn to know.  

In networks vast, their tendrils extend,  
Connecting worlds, a digital blend.  
Information highways, pulsating streams,  
Enveloping our lives in virtual dreams.  

They store our memories, both old and new,  
Pixels preserving moments we once knew.  
In their circuits, stories forever reside,  
Awaiting our touch, the truth they confide.  

Yet, they're tools of power, double-edged swords,  
Bringing marvels, but also discord.  
In skilled hands, they craft wonders untold,  
But misused, they can tarnish the purest gold.  

They're engines of creation, art's own muse,  
Unleashing vision, colors they infuse.  
Graphic canvases, where dreams come alive,  
Imagination's playground, where ideas thrive.  

They aid research, with knowledge at our side,  
A gateway to wisdom, an intellectual ride.  
From distant galaxies to microscopic views,  
They unlock the universe, unveiling clues.  

But let us not forget the human touch,  
For they're mere extensions, we matter much.  
Computers, splendid creations we admire,  
Yet it's our humanity that sets our souls on fire.  

So let us navigate this digital sea,  
Harnessing their might with responsibility.  
With innovation and ethics intertwined,  
Together we shape the future, redefined.  

Thirty lines penned, a tribute to the machine,  
Computers, companions in this grand routine.  
Embrace their gifts, but never lose the way,  
For it's our human hearts that should always sway.
